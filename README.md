# Backward-Traversal



The project takes parsed Verilog files as input and performs a reverse traversal on the data, efficiently navigating the hierarchical structure. This repo contains multiple backward traversal algorithms to analyze and process the parsed data.

To understand the flow of the code go through <a href="https://github.com/Rahul28428/Backward-Traversal/blob/main/PPT.pdf "> PPT </a>

The codes are explained in detail in the <a href="https://github.com/Rahul28428/Backward-Traversal/blob/main/Report.pdf "> Report</a>
